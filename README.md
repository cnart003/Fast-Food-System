# Restaurant Order Management System

This is a simple C program that simulates a basic restaurant order management system. The program allows customers to place orders, calculates the bill including sales tax, and generates a sales summary. The sales summary is also saved to a text file.

## Features

- **Menu Display**: Shows the customer the available menu items with prices.
- **Order Input**: Allows customers to place orders by selecting items from the menu and specifying quantities.
- **Bill Calculation**: Calculates the subtotal, tax, and total bill for the customer's order.
- **Sales Summary**: Tracks the total number of orders, total revenue, and revenue generated by each menu item. This information is saved to a `salesBook.txt` file.

## Program Structure

- **Data Structures**
  - `struct order`: Represents a customer's order, including order ID, customer name, the items ordered, and the item count.
  - `struct items`: Represents a menu item with a name and price.

- **Functions**
  - `void displayMenu(struct items *menuItems, int menuSize)`: Displays the menu to the customer.
  - `void inputOrder(struct items *menuItems, int menuSize, struct order *customerOrders, int *orderCount, int orderID)`: Inputs the customer's order.
  - `void calculateBill(struct order *customerOrders, int orderCount)`: Calculates and displays the bill for each order.
  - `void salesSummary(struct order *customerOrders, int orderCount)`: Displays a summary of all sales and writes it to a `salesBook.txt` file.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Program**: Use a C compiler to compile the program.
   ```bash
   gcc -o restaurant_order_system restaurant_order_system.c
